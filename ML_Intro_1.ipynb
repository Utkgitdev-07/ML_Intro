    "#Ans--Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. AI can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing speech and images, and making decisions. AI can be divided into two main categories:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "i) Narrow or Weak AI\n",
    "ii) General or Strong AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of AI is self-driving cars. These cars use computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze their surroundings and make decisions based on that analysis. They can navigate traffic, avoid obstacles, and make decisions based on traffic laws and road conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that uses statistical techniques to enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task by learning from data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. Machine learning algorithms can be classified into three main categories:\n",
    "i) Supervised Learning\n",
    "ii) Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "iii) Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is email filtering. Email providers like Gmail use machine learning algorithms to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam. The algorithm learns from patterns in the text and other features of the email to make a prediction about whether the email is spam or not.\n",

    "Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning algorithms use multiple layers of interconnected nodes to process and learn from data. Deep learning is capable of learning from unstructured data such as images, videos, and audio.\n",
    "Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models can be trained to identify objects within images, such as cars or people. These models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the features of an image and classify it into different categories based on those features. For example, a deep learning model could be trained to identify different breeds of dogs within a photo.'''"
